                         6) Love Your Neighbor
     
     * Great ideas help all mankind (not just iphone users)
     * The great question for our time is, how to make sure that
       the continuing scientific revolution brings benefits to
       everybody rather than widening the gap between rich and
       poor. To lift up poor countries, and poor people in rich
       countries, from poverty, to give them a chance of a decent
       life, technology is not enough. Technology must be guided
       and driven by ethics if it is to do more than provide new
       toys for the rich.
